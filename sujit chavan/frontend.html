<h2>What is a frontend?</h2>
<p>A website's or software program's front end is the interface through which users perform key actions. A user
    <br>who visits an app or browser can access different sections and functionalities. 
<br>
<br>
    The front end of any website or application contains programming that makes certain features available to users. <br>
    In comparison, a backend has data processing and key background functions required to make the application work. </p>
<h2>Advantages of frontend programming</h2>
<p>
   <b> The advantages of frontend programming include:</b>

<li><b>Quick Development</b></li>
The main advantage of front-end programming is that it can be performed faster. The cutting-edge technological <br>
advancements and frameworks available for front-end development make tasks faster. 
<br>
<br>As a result, creating the final product takes a lot less time. Creating a front-end for an application that <br>
already has a ready and robust backend is a fast and easy proposition. As a result, developing fully functional <br>
front-ends is rarely a challenge for experienced developers. 
<br>
<li><b>Secure Environment</b></li>
Fron-tend development is also beneficial because all front-end frameworks offer a highly secure environment for <br>
coding. It is particularly advantageous for users as they can preserve code and websites across multiple browsers. 
<br>
<li><b>Fast Response</b></li>
The new framework technology used by developers lets them easily create fast response features that facilitate <br>
the efficient reaction, response, and functioning of applications.
